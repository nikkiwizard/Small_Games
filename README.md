# Small Games
 - Small python games I've coded. 
 - Basically, some of the text-based games all beginner coders have done.
 - Some of them have my own twist on them, so have fun! :)

List of the Games:
 - Defeat Computer Game
 - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPS File)
 - Hangman for two players!
 - Guess the Secret Number
 - Mad Libs (original story by me)
